# SudokuPuzzles
This program will accept a list of sudoku puzzles and solve them. This is based off [Project Euler Problem #96](https://projecteuler.net/problem=96), so it currently has the list of 50 sudoku puzzles that it solves. For this problem we were also asked to find the sum of the 3 numbers in the top-left of each solution, which was used to verify successful completion.
